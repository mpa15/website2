title: "Long-term Seizure Outcomes Following Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery in Children with Hemispheric Lesions: Hemispherectomy vs Limited Resections"
summary: "Clinicians caring for children with drug resistant epilepsy in the setting of large hemispheric or multilobar lesions are often faced with a difficult surgical decision. Hemispherectomy incurs significant deficits, but has a better chance of seizure freedom. In contrast, smaller lobar/multilobar resections may limit deficits but if unsuccessful lead to multiple surgeries and may prolong time to seizure freedom.  This decision becomes especially difficult in patients with minor or no existing deficits. The present study explores the  longitudinal seizure outcomes and developmental trajectories of patients for whom both surgical options were considered."
